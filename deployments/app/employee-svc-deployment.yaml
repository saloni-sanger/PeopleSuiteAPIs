#selector chooses the pods, template describes how the pods are created
#env 
#doesn't matter what you call the deployment, it's looking for matchLabels
#k8 manifest: describes application
#yaml, deployment

#service already connected to deployment (right now, the yaml created the container/pods for us, but it's not exposed)
#needs an ingress to expose service
#An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. (kubernetes.io)
#Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting (kubernetes.io)
#service (prob pod-scope) and ingress (prob cluster-scope) independantly do their own kind of load balancing

#rewrite target in the ingress annotation: changing the path comiung in to a different one (that's used internally)
#matching a path to a service

#now i need to work with the python file and add paths to the ingress !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#make a script 

#will need a 2nd dockerfile later to build departmentService
