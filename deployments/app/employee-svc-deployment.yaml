#container and pods created by yaml, but they aren't exposed
#ingress needed to expose service:
  #An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. (kubernetes.io)
  #Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting (kubernetes.io)
#service (prob pod-scope) and ingress (prob cluster-scope) independantly do their own kind of load balancing
